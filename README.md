<p align="center">بِسْمِ اللّهِ الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيْ</p> 

Hi, I'm Sahibul, I'm a Flutter Developer 🚀 from Indonesia.

The Acehnese Dictionary App is a mobile application that serves as a dictionary for the Acehnese language. The Acehnese language is spoken by the Acehnese people, who primarily reside in the Aceh province of Indonesia. This app provides users with a tool to learn and understand the Acehnese language.

The app features an easy-to-use interface with a search function, allowing users to search for Acehnese words and their definitions in Indonesian and English. Additionally, the app includes sample pictures based on vocabulary.

The Acehnese Dictionary App is a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning the Acehnese language, as well as for Acehnese speakers looking to improve their vocabulary.
